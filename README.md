What
----

vaultsmith is a tool for provisioning instances of Hashicorp Vault, for example by setting up 
roles and access permissions. The goal is to support a _declarative_ style of configuration, 
i.e. the configuration reflects the final state, and executions are idempotent.

This project is under active development, and third party contributions are most welcome. 

Documentation is lacking at this point, and given its early stage, it should only be used on 
test servers.

Concept
-------
A couple of years ago, Hashicorp published a blog post 
["Codifying Vault Policies and Configuration"](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/codifying-vault-policies-and-configuration.html). 
We used a heavily modified version of their scripts to get us going with Vault. Vaultsmith is 
really just an extension of that idea, except that it uses the official Go client, and
obviously is written in Go as well.

Essentially, the directory structure (document-path) reflects the API endpoints of Vault,
and the contents of the document within is posted to Vault, using the built-in Vault client. 
It gets more complicated when you consider endpoints such as sys/auth and sys/policy have
special methods in the Vault client, so these directories are assigned specific handlers which
call the appropriate methods.

Installation
--------
#### Native Go
```bash
go get github.com/starlingbank/vaultsmith
```

#### Docker
The image is not published, but you can build it after go get with:
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/starlingbank/vaultsmith
make docker
```

Usage
-----

```
$ vaultsmith -h
Usage of vaultsmith:
      --document-path string      The root directory of the configuration. Can be a local directory, local gz tarball or http url to a gz tarball.
      --dry                       Dry run; will read from but not write to vault
      --http-auth-token string    Auth token to pass as 'Authorization' header. Useful for passing user tokens to private github repos.
      --log-level string          Log level, valid values are [panic fatal error warning info debug] (default "info")
      --role string               The Vault role to authenticate as (default "root")
      --tar-dir string            Directory within the tarball to use as the document-path. If not specified, and there is only one directory within the archive, that one will be used. If there is more than one diretory, the root directory of the archive will be used.
      --template-file string      JSON file containing template mappings. If not specified, vaultsmith will look for "template.json" in the base of the document path.
      --template-params strings   Template parameters. Applies globally, but values in template-file take precedence. E.G.: service=foo,account=bar
```

It is _strongly_ recommended that you use the --dry option before running against any live server.
This ensures that no writes can happen during the run. If it indicates that it would do something 
unexpected, set log-level to debug with `--log-level debug` and it will show you (in go terms) 
exactly what it would write. If that looks wrong to you, please raise a bug!

It is important to remember that directories which are present in document-path reflect the final 
state. Thus, if you created an empty directory within document-path called say, "secrets", and ran 
it against your server, _all documents under this path would be deleted from Vault!_ 

Thus, ensure any vaultsmith-managed documents are in a separate path to user-managed documents. Or
use it for configuration endpoints only as intended :)

Paths not present in document-path will not be affected.

Templating
----------

Documentation required, but see example/template.json for an example.

Examples
--------
Run up a test vault server and export your token:
```bash
docker run -p 8200:8200 vault:latest
export VAULT_TOKEN=$root_token
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
```
Run vaultsmith and it should apply the example document set:
```bash
vaultsmith -document-path https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starlingbank/vaultsmith/master/example/example.tar.gz
```

Pulling archives from private Github repositories
-------------------------------------------------

As github tarballs place the repository in a subdirectory, a little more work is needed. If for
example you have your vault documents in directory called "data", which is within a git repository 
(I.E repository_root/data):
```bash
vaultsmith --document-path https://api.github.com/repos/$ORG/$REPO/tarball/master --http-auth-token $TOKEN --tar-dir $ORG-$REPO-$COMMIT_SHA/data --dry
```
See the [Github API docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release) for
more information.

You can sidestep this by placing the documents at the root of the repository, and having nothing
else in it, but the recommended solution is to create and upload your own tarballs to a private
repository.
